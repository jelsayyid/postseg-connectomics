# Experiment Log

This document tracks testing experiments, results, and observations as the pipeline is validated.

## Experiment 1: Baseline Unit Test Suite

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Objective:** Establish baseline — verify all existing unit and integration tests pass.

**Setup:**
- Python 3.10.12, pytest 8.3.1
- All tests run against synthetic in-memory data (no external volumes)
- Install: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`

**Results:**
```
72 passed in 5.22s
```

| Module | Tests | Passed | Failed | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| I/O | 9 | 9 | 0 | NumpyReader + HDF5 roundtrip |
| Fragments | 16 | 16 | 0 | Extraction, store, metadata, skeletonization |
| Graph | 9 | 9 | 0 | Graph construction + spatial index |
| Candidates | 16 | 16 | 0 | All scoring functions + generation |
| Validation | 12 | 12 | 0 | All 7 rules + pipeline |
| Assembly | 8 | 8 | 0 | Topology detection + confidence |
| Pipeline (E2E) | 2 | 2 | 0 | Full run + export verification |

**Observations:**
- All 72 tests pass cleanly with no warnings
- Test execution is fast (~5s total) — all synthetic, no disk I/O bottleneck
- End-to-end test covers fragment extraction through export but uses minimal validation (single MaxDistanceRule)
- No coverage measurement yet — needs `pytest-cov` to quantify

**Action Items:**
- [x] Run coverage analysis to identify untested code paths (see Experiment 2)
- [ ] Expand E2E tests with more realistic validation configurations
- [ ] Begin Phase 2: stress testing with varied synthetic data

## Experiment 2: Coverage Analysis

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Objective:** Measure line coverage to identify untested code paths and prioritize gap-filling.

**Setup:**
- `pip install pytest-cov`
- `pytest tests/ --cov=connectomics_pipeline --cov-report=term-missing`

**Results:**

**Overall: 68% line coverage (1178/1721 statements covered)**

| Module | Coverage | Missing Lines | Priority |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------|
| `cli.py` | **0%** | All 22 lines | Low (CLI wrapper) |
| `io/precomputed_reader.py` | **0%** | All 30 lines | Medium (needs cloud-volume) |
| `io/zarr_reader.py` | **0%** | All 28 lines | Medium (needs zarr files) |

| `export/graph_export.py` | **23%** | 43/56 lines | **High** (key output) |

### Coverage by Category

| Category | Avg Coverage | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Core logic (candidates, validation, assembly) | ~92% | Strong |
| I/O (numpy, hdf5) | ~98% | Strong |
| I/O (zarr, precomputed) | 0% | Needs optional deps |
| Fragments (extract, store, metadata) | ~90% | Good |
| Fragments (stitching, mesh, skeleton) | ~46% | **Weak** |
| Export (graph, swc, neuroglancer) | ~31% | **Weak** |
| Utilities (spatial, config, logging) | ~59% | Moderate |
| Visualization | 0% | Not tested |
| Pipeline orchestration | 72% | Moderate |

**Observations:**
- Core algorithmic logic (scoring, validation rules, assembly) is well-tested at ~92%
- **Biggest gaps are in export formats and fragment stitching** — these are important for real-world use
- `utils/spatial.py` at 44% is concerning since it's a utility used across modules
- Visualization modules (0%) are low priority — plotting code is hard to unit test meaningfully
- Zero coverage on `cli.py`, `zarr_reader.py`, `precomputed_reader.py` is expected (CLI is a thin wrapper; Zarr/precomputed need optional deps)
- The pipeline orchestrator at 72% could be improved with more E2E test scenarios

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Write tests for `export/graph_export.py` (GraphML + JSON export)
- [ ] Write tests for `export/swc_export.py` (SWC morphology export)
- [ ] Write tests for `fragments/stitching.py` (cross-chunk fragment merging)
- [ ] Write tests for `utils/spatial.py` (distance, direction, angle utilities)
- [ ] Add E2E test with all validation rules enabled
- [ ] Add E2E test that exercises GraphML and SWC export paths
- [ ] Target: raise overall coverage from 68% to >85%
